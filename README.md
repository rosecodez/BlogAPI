# BlogAPI

With this project I have practiced:

- API endpoints with Postman
  - keep related api endpoints together for easier navigation and management
  - facilitate clear API documentation by grouping endpoints logically within folders
  - fetch data from the new API and display it on page for users/author

- Route protection with JWT
  - use of Passport's JWT strategy to verify JWTs
  - deny or allow access to the rest of the protected route
  - when user logs out, the client will remove the JWT from storage
